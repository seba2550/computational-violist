I am an incoming graduate student at *REDACTED*

### Research Interests:
  * Multi-omics Approaches
  * Personalized Medicine
  * Machine Learning
  * Population Genetics and Evolution

I graduated from the University of Puerto Rico, RÃ­o Piedras Campus in May 2020 with a major in Molecular and Cell Biology. I've studied all kinds of cool things, including viscera and nervous tissue regeneration in sea cucumbers, SNPs in 3 prime UTRs, SVs in luminal breast cancer that influence therapy resistance, and the gene regulatory architechture of MS in Puerto Rican individuals. During my Ph.D. training I plan to work on human genetics/disease to provide new insights on how powerful computational approaches can be used to improve the way we diagnose, treat, and think about disease, all in a personalized and inclusive manner. 

### Other Interests
I am a clasically trained violist and enjoy watersports such as kitesurfing and sailing quite a bit. In my spare time I read books about history and science fiction, play videogames, and listen to music.
